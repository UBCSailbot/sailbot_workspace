version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions" # See documentation for possible values
    directory: "/" # Location of package manifests
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    # Create a group of dependencies to be updated together in one pull request
    groups:
       # Specify a name for the group, which will be used in pull request titles
       # and branch names
       gh-actions:
          # Define patterns to include dependencies in the group (based on
          # dependency name)
          patterns:
            # - "rubocop" # A single dependency name
            # - "rspec*"  # A wildcard string that matches multiple dependency names
            - "*"       # A wildcard that matches all dependencies in the package
                        # ecosystem. Note: using "*" may open a large pull request
