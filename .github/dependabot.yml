    # # Create a group of dependencies to be updated together in one pull request
    # groups:
    #    # Specify a name for the group, which will be used in pull request titles
    #    # and branch names
    #    gh-actions:
    #       # Define patterns to include dependencies in the group (based on
    #       # dependency name)
    #       patterns:
    #         # - "rubocop" # A single dependency name
    #         # - "rspec*"  # A wildcard string that matches multiple dependency names
    #         - "*"       # A wildcard that matches all dependencies in the package
    #                     # ecosystem. Note: using "*" may open a large pull request
