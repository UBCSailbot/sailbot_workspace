<!--
Tasklist guidelines:
- Considering pinning the tasklist issue
- Add the tasklist issue and task issues to the Software project
- To create a task from an existing issue, reference its number: e.g., #739
    - Can link a closed issue for reference to have a complete record of what needs to be done.
- If a new issue needs to be created in the process of making a task list, (e.g. a PR resolves a task that isn't an issue), create one
    - If a task needs extra detail, create an issue using one of the issue templates and link the it here
    - If a task is self-explanatory, can directly convert it into an issue
        - Remember to go into the issue and add the relevant assignees and labels, as well as link it to the Software project
