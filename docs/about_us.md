# About Us

[UBC Sailbot](https://www.ubcsailbot.org/){target=_blank} is an engineering design team at The University of British Columbia
that designs, constructs, and tests autonomous sailboats. We have 3 technical sub-teams: Mechanical, Electrical, and Software.

This repository, [sailbot_workspace](https://github.com/UBCSailbot/sailbot_workspace){target=_blank}, contains all the
code, infrastructure, and documentation for the project we are currently working on, Polaris.
