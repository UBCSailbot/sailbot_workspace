# Getting Started

UBC Sailbot's Network Systems team uses C++ for its software. If you know already know C, then you already know the
bare minimum to write C++. This is a good starting point, but the additional features C++ provides allow for safer
programming practices.

## For C/C++ Beginners

If you just need to know how C++ is different from C, then see the [Differences Between C and C++](./differences.md).
You should also look at it if you go through and finish this section.

If you are new to C and C++, then this the best place to start. The tutorials provided in this section will help you
learn the fundamentals of the language. Do not feel pressured to do all the tutorials! Just get comfortable with the
syntax and the mechanisms of the language.

!!! note
    The hardest part about this will likely be pointers and dynamic memory, so pay close attention to tutorials
    concerning them! Additionally, dynamic memory requires the usage of pointers, but pointers do not require dynamic
    memory!

!!! tip
    Dynamic memory is much more prone to error than statically allocated memory, so try to use static allocation
    whenever possible
