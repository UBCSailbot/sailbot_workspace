# Getting Started

We use Python 3 to write the majority of our software at UBC Sailbot. Pathfinding and Controls mainly use Python 3,
so it is critical that you are familiar with the language if you are on one of these sub-teams.

## Python tutorials

We understand that not everyone who joins Sailbot has Python in their toolkit, nor do we expect it either! Whether you
are learning Python for the first time or you just want to brush up, we have provided some resources below. You may not
learn absolutely everything from the resources below, but it is a good starting point. You will mostly learn through doing,
as you would with most technical skills!

| Resource               | Description                                                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/){target=_blank} | The official python tutorial. Good if you have some time on your hands and you are a completionist. Sections 1 - 5 and 9 are the most relevant. |
| [w3schools Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp){target=_blank} | Good if you want a more brief introduction to Python. It breaks down a lot of concepts into sections. Everything up to Python Classes/Objects is relevant. |
| [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/t8pPdKYpowI){target=_blank} | If you like video tutorials, then we recommend this tutorial. This video is about 5 hours long, but it pretty much covers everything that you'll need to know for Python and there are some hands on  projects. |
| [Shorter YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8){target=_blank} | A shorter alternative YouTube tutorial condensed into 1 hour. It covers less material but still covers many of the essentials. |
| [CodingBat Practice](https://codingbat.com/python){target=_blank} | Good resource to put your Python skills to practice on some simple coding problems. Note that this resource does not teach you python. |

Feel free to add other resources other than the ones listed above if you find any that you like!
