# Sailing Knowledge Section Overview

In order to make high-quality contributions to Sailbot's Software teams, it is extremely helpful to have some
understanding of sailing. This section introduces important parts of a sailboat, explains the 4 types of turns,
discusses upwind and downwind sailing, and covers some other helpful knowledge.

In this section, terms which are ***Bolded and Italicized*** are the most important terms to know.
These terms are listed at the bottom of each page.
Terms that are only *Italicized* are other helpful sailing terms.
Words that are **bolded** are meant to be emphasized, but are not necessarily considered important vocabulary.
