# Setup Instructions

Sailbot Workspace can be run on Windows, Linux, or macOS, but is the easiest to set up and performs the best on
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/){target=_blank} and [its derivatives](https://distrowatch.com/search.php?basedon=Ubuntu){target=_blank}.
The workspace may not perform well on Windows computers with 8GB of memory or less;
in this case, please check out our recommendations in the [Performance Issues](./help.md#performance-issues){target=_blank}
section.

## 1. Setup prerequisites

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/){target=_blank} is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization[^1] to develop, ship, and
run applications.[^2] We use it to separate our applications from our infrastructure[^2] so that we can update and
version control our infrastructure for every use case (software members, CI, deployment) in one place: this repository.

[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/){target=_blank} is a software used to run Docker.
However, it can only be installed on Linux.
[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/){target=_blank} is a software used to run Docker in a VM,[^3]
allowing it to be installed on Windows and macOS in addition to Linux.

=== ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"

    1. Set up prerequisites, WSL and Ubuntu:

        1. In PowerShell, run `wsl --install Ubuntu`, then `exit`, `wsl --update`, and `wsl --set-default Ubuntu`

            ??? warning "Ubuntu is already installed?"

                If Ubuntu is already installed, check that it is the right WSL version:

                1. Check the WSL versions of Linux distributions with `wsl -l -v`
                2. If Ubuntu's `VERSION` is 1, upgrade it to WSL 2 with `wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2`

        2. Open the Ubuntu app to set up or verify its configuration:
            1. If you are opening Ubuntu for the first time, a setup process will run;
            follow the prompts to finish setting it up
            2. Run `whoami` to verify that it returns your Ubuntu username

                ??? bug "`whoami` returns `root`"

                    If `whoami` returns `root`:

                    1. [Create a non-root user with sudo privileges](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-and-delete-users-on-ubuntu-20-04){target=_blank}
                    2. Change the default Ubuntu user to this newly-created user: run `ubuntu config --default-user <username>`
                    in PowerShell, replacing `<username>` with the name of the newly-created user
                    3. Run `whoami` after closing and reopening Ubuntu, verifying that it returns your Ubuntu username

    2. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/){target=_blank}
    with the WSL 2 backend

        ??? bug "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL Error"

            ![image](../../assets/images/sailbot_workspace/workflow/sailbot_bug.png)

            If the above error shows when trying to start Docker Desktop on your laptop:

            1. For windows users navigate to `C:\Users\user_name` and delete the .Docker folder
            2. Restart Docker Desktop

        ??? bug "Docker Desktop can't start up and WSL hangs when restarting"

            If Ubuntu can't start up and WSL hangs when restarting:

            1. Open command prompt as administrator and run the command `netsh winsock reset`
            2. Uninstall and reinstall Docker Desktop
            3. Restart your computer

=== ":material-linux: Linux"

    1. [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/){target=_blank}
        - As of February 2023, Sailbot Workspace (more specifically its use of VS Code Dev Containers) isn't compatible
          with Docker Desktop for Linux; if you have Docker Desktop installed, uninstall it and install Docker Engine instead.
    2. [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user){target=_blank}
    3. [Configure Docker to start on boot](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot){target=_blank}

### VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=_blank} is a powerful and customizable code editor for
Windows, Linux, and macOS. We strongly recommend that you use this editor to develop our software so that you can
use all the features of Sailbot Workspace.

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview){target=_blank}
2. Install the [Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack){target=_blank}

### Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from
small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.[^4]

1. Check if Git is installed with `git --version` (on Windows, run command in PowerShell)
    - If not installed, download and install it from [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/download){target=_blank}
2. Configure your name and email: [Git config file setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git#git-config-file-setup){target=_blank}
   (on Windows, run commands in Ubuntu)
3. Login to GitHub

    === ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"

        1. Run the `git config` command for your Git version in [Git Credential Manager setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git#git-credential-manager-setup){target=_blank} (run command in Ubuntu)

            !!! warning "Which Git to check"

                Git is installed seperately in Windows and Ubuntu, so they could be at different versions.
                We want to check the version of Git on Windows, not Ubuntu:
                run `git --version` in PowerShell and not Ubuntu.
                However, the `git config` command itself is run in Ubuntu.

    === ":material-apple: macOS / :material-linux: Linux"

        1. Install the GitHub CLI: [Installation](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation){target=_blank}
        2. Run `gh auth login` and select the first option for all choices

4. Verify that you have successfully logged in to GitHub by cloning a private GitHub repository (run command in Ubuntu)
    1. If you are a part of the [UBCSailbot Software GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/UBCSailbot/teams/software-team){target=_blank},
       you shouldn't see any errors running `git clone https://github.com/UBCSailbot/raye-ais.git`
    2. You can delete this repository with `rm -rf raye-ais`

[^4]: [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com){target=_blank}

## 2. Setup X11 forwarding

X11 forwarding is a mechanism that enables Sailbot Workspace to run GUI applications.

!!! warning ""

    You can skip this step since we currently aren't running any GUI applications

??? info "Setup instructions for X11 forwarding"

    1. Ensure that the versions of VS Code and its Dev Containers extension support X11 forwarding:
        1. VS Code version >= 1.75
        2. Dev Containers version >= 0.275.1
    2. Verify that `echo $DISPLAY` returns something like `:0`

        ??? warning "`echo $DISPLAY` doesn't return anything"

            If `echo $DISPLAY` doesn't return anything, set it to `:0` on shell initialization:

            1. Find out what shell you are using with `echo $SHELL`
                1. Most Linux distributions use Bash by default, whose rc file path is `~/.bashrc`
                2. macOS uses Zsh by default, whose rc file path is: `~/.zshrc`
            2. Run `echo 'export DISPLAY=:0' >> <rc file path>`, replacing `<rc file path>`
            with the path to your shell's rc file
            3. Run `echo $DISPLAY` after closing and reopening your terminal, verifying it returns something like `:0`

    3. Install a X11 server

        === ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"

            WSL includes a X11 server.

        === ":material-apple: macOS"

            1. Set up XQuartz following [this guide](https://gist.github.com/sorny/969fe55d85c9b0035b0109a31cbcb088){target=_blank}
            2. Copy the default xinitrc to your home directory: `cp /opt/X11/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc`
            3. Add `xhost +localhost` to `~/.xinitrc` after its first line

        === ":material-linux: Linux"

            === ":material-linux: General"

                As of February 2023, almost all Linux distributions include a X11 server, Xorg.
                This may change in the future as Wayland matures.

            === ":material-arch: Arch Linux"

                1. Install xhost: `sudo pacman -S xorg-xhost`
                2. Copy the default xinitrc to your home directory: `cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc`
                3. Add `xhost +local:docker` to `~/.xinitrc` after its first line

    4. Verify that X11 forwarding works:
        1. Install `x11-apps`

            === ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"

                In Ubuntu, `sudo apt install x11-apps`.

            === ":material-apple: macOS"

                XQuartz includes `x11-apps`. Ensure that XQuartz is running.

            === ":material-linux: Linux"

                Install `x11-apps` using your desired package manager.

        2. Verify that running `xcalc` opens a calculator and that you can use it

## 3. Clone Sailbot Workspace

!!! tip "Where to clone on Windows"

    **Run the command below in the Ubuntu app** to clone it in the Ubuntu file system, otherwise sailbot workspace will not work.
    Windows has a native file system as well as file systems for each WSL distribution.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UBCSailbot/sailbot_workspace.git
```

## 4. Open Sailbot Workspace in VS Code

1. Install `code` command in `PATH`

    === ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"

        The `code` command is installed by default.

    === ":material-apple: macOS"

        See [launching from the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line){target=_blank}.

    === ":material-linux: Linux"

        The `code` command is installed by default.

2. Open the `sailbot_workspace/` directory in VS Code: run `code <relative path to sailbot workspace>`
    - For example, if you just cloned the repository, the command would be `code sailbot_workspace`

## 5. Open the workspace file

Click the popup to `Open Workspace`. If there isn't a popup:

1. Open the file `sailbot.code-workspace` in VS Code
2. Click `Open Workspace`

## 6. Open Sailbot Workspace in a Dev Container

1. Ensure that Docker is running
2. Click the popup to `Reopen in Container`. If there isn't a popup,
   run the `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` VS Code command

## 7. Run the `Build All` task

!!! warning "Wait before running"

    Ensure that the `postCreateCommand from devcontainer.json` has completed before running this task.

The `Build All` task builds all the ROS packages.

## 8. Reload the VS Code terminals and window

Delete all open terminals and run the `Developer: Reload Window` VS Code command
to detect the files that were generated from building.

## 9. Start the system

Run the entire system to verify everything is working using the following command in the VS Code terminal:

```sh
ros2 launch $ROS_WORKSPACE/src/global_launch/main_launch.py
```

Use ++ctrl+c++ in the terminal to stop the system.

## Setup Sailbot Workspace in a GitHub Codespace

A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud.[^5]
Since Sailbot Workspace is resource intensive, it has high hardware requirements and power consumption,
which aren't ideal for development on laptops. GitHub Codespaces provide a seamless experience to work on repositories
off-device, especially if they specify a Dev Container like Sailbot Workspace. Codespaces can run in VS Code
or even in a browser for times when you aren't on your programming computer.

1. Create a GitHub Codespace following the steps in the relevant GitHub Docs page:
[create a codespace for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository){target=_blank}.
A couple things to note:
    - For the best Sailbot Workspace development experience, select the high-spec machine available
    - There are usage limits if you don't want to pay:
    [monthly included storage and core hours for personal accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts){target=_blank}
        - Upgrade to a Pro account for increased usage limits (this is free for students):
        [apply to GitHub Global Campus as a student](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-students/apply-to-github-global-campus-as-a-student){target=_blank}
        - Stop your codespace as soon as you are done using it:
        [stopping a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace#stopping-a-codespace){target=_blank}
        - Delete codespaces that you do not plan to use anymore:
        [deleting a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/deleting-a-codespace#deleting-a-codespace){target=_blank}
2. Follow the local setup instructions starting from [5. Open the workspace file](#5-open-the-workspace-file)

Once you have a codespace set up:

- Open it by following the steps in the relevant GitHub Docs page:
[reopening a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/opening-an-existing-codespace#reopening-a-codespace){target=_blank}
- Close it by running the `Codespaces: Stop Current Codespace` VS Code command

!!! warning "Known limitations of running Sailbot Workspace in a GitHub Codespace"

    - Does not support X11 forwarding to run GUI applications
    - High-spec machines not available: as of March 2023, the highest-spec machine that is publically available
      has a 4-core CPU and 8GB of RAM
