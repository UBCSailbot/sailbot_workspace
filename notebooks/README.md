# Notebooks

UBC Sailbot's Jupyter notebooks for researching and exporing implementations.

## Standards

1. In addition to the dependencies installed in [Sailbot Workspace](https://github.com/UBCSailbot/sailbot_workspace),
notebooks may have additional dependencies that are installed in the first code block
2. Implementations in notebooks should be complete: do not import functions from other UBC Sailbot repositories
3. Notebooks should be organized into directories named like the UBC Sailbot repositories they correspond to
