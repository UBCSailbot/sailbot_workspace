# Notebooks

UBC Sailbot's Jupyter notebooks for researching and exporing implementations.

## Setup

To get started using notebooks in the devcontainer:

1. run `install_notebook_env.sh`
2. ctl + shift + p  `Developer: Reload Window`
3. open a `.ipynb` file and select the kernel: _Python (notebook_env)_. If the kernel env does not appear, try clicking refresh or keep running Developer: Reload Window until it does.

## Standards

1. Notebooks should be organized into directories named like the UBC Sailbot repositories they correspond to
