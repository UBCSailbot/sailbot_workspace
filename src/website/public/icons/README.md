We get all our icons from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

Generally we use these options:
Size: 30
Weight: 400
Grade: 0
Optical Size: 24

Let's name all our icons as they are on the website in snake case.

Very very great and super useful resource: [SVG Viewer](https://www.svgviewer.dev/)
