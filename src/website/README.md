# Website

In the website development timeline, we are currently evaluating the folllowing software stack:
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) website (this repository) and the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.
The easiest way to evaluate these potential solutions for our purposes is in [sailbot_workspace](https://github.com/UBCSailbot/sailbot_workspace).

## Database

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application
developers and for the cloud era. If you want to learn more about MongoDB, visit their docs site: [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/).

## Setup

### Environment variables

This project uses environment variables to manage configuration-specific information. Please look at the file
`.env.local` and ensure the variables are defined below:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string. Use `mongodb://localhost:27017/<DB_NAME>` to establish a connection
  with the local database.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_HOST`: The host URL of the website.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_PORT`: The port number of the website.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLLING_TIME_MS`: The time interval for polling the database in milliseconds.

### Package installation

The following command installs all required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, you should see a `node_modules` directory in the project's root.
This directory contains all installed packages.

When installing a new package to the website, please follow the steps below:

1. Access the terminal of the website container on Docker.

2. Run the command `npm install <package-name>`.
   Replace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package you want to add.

   - Should you encounter errors related to resolving peer dependencies, please re-run the command with
     the header `--legacy-peer-deps`. Do not to use `--force` unless you're well aware of the potential consequences.

3. Review the `package.json` file to ensure the new package and its version have been added to the dependencies section.
   - Confirm that `package-lock.json` has also been updated.
     This file holds specific version information to ensure consistent installations across different environments.
4. Once the installation process is finished, please make sure to commit the files `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
   These files are essential for version controlling the dependencies that have been added.

## Run

Using [Sailbot Workspace](https://github.com/UBCSailbot/sailbot_workspace),
the website should be up and running on [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005).

Otherwise, you execute the following commands to run it in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Linters

Before merging in new changes to the repository, please execute the following commands in order:

```bash
npm run format
```

This command runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) to automatically format the code according to
the rules defined in the configuration file `.prettierrc`.

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started) to analyze the code for potential errors
and enforce coding style based on the rules defined in the configuration file `.eslintrc`.
