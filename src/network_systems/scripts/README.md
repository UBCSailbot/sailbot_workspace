## Rockblock Web Server

This web server is a virtual implementation of the Rockblock Web Servers used to send MT messages. The specification for
 the RockBlock Web Servers can be found
 [here](https://docs.groundcontrol.com/iot/rockblock/web-services/sending-mt-message).

This virtual server follows this specification with one notable difference, it will return the specific error code that
is contained in the `data` section of the request sent to it.

So a request to this url: <http://localhost:8100/?data=B&imei=300434065264590&username=myuser> will return
`FAILED,11, No RockBLOCK with this IMEI found on your account` since `data=B` and B is hex for 11 which is the
 corresponding error code as mentioned above.
