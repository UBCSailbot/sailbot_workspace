# Docs Image

Used for running [our docs site](https://ubcsailbot.github.io/sailbot_workspace/main/).

## Features

- Builds off the [`squidfunk/mkdocs-material`](https://hub.docker.com/r/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) image
- Installs the dependencies of the site located in the `docs/` folder of [`src/`](../../src/)
- When image is run, runs docs on port 8000
