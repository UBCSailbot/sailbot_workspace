# Personal Configuration Files

Copy your personal configuration files (e.g., `.vimrc`) to this directory
to add them to the Dev Container.

## Notes

- Files in this directory are ignored by Git.
- To add aliases and functions to bash, put them in `.aliases.bash` and `.functions.bash`, respectively.
